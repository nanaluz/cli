## Development

Developing the CLI locally requires Ruby >= 2.0. While developing please follow
the [CLI development guide](guides.md).

To run the CLI locally, use the `bundle exec sem`.

#### Generating Docs

First, generate a JSON structure of the CLI, by running:

``` bash
./bin/generate_json_structure
```

Use that structure to generate docs in the semaphore-docs-new repository.

#### Semaphore Resource Name (SRN)

SRN is a way of identifying Semaphore resources. This CLI uses SRNs as arguments
for all actions.

Formats for individual resources are the following:

- Organization: `organization_name`
- Team: `organization_name/team_name`
- Project: `organization_name/project_name`
- Shared Configuration: `organization_name/shared_configuration_name`

#### Using custom API URL

Create a file at `~/.sem/api_url` containing only the custom url.
